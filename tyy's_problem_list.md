### Problem_list
>In this markdown file, the author (Tyy) has recorded his favorite algorithm problems, which are also relatively challenging, and thus worth revisiting and studying repeatedly.

>The Problems are sorted based on the topics

##### Two Pointers
1. *2831: Find the Longest Equal Subarray*
- You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. A subarray is called equal if all of its elements are equal. Note that the empty subarray is an equal subarray. Return the length of the longest possible equal subarray after deleting at most k elements from nums.

Example: 
`Input: nums = [1,3,2,3,1,3], k = 3`
`Output: 3`
Explanation: It's optimal to delete the elements at index `2` and index `4`.
After deleting them, nums becomes equal to `[1, 3, 3, 3]`.
The longest equal subarray starts at `i = 1` and ends at `j = 3` with length equal to `3`. 
It can be proven that no longer equal subarrays can be created.

> Notice the element is not replaced, so the standard `right - left + 1` cannot be applied here. Rather, you can travser the `dict` to see if satisfy the `k` factor.

```python
def longestEqualSubarray(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        count = defaultdict(list)
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            count[num].append(i)
        res = 0
        for tmp in count.values():
            left = 0
            for right in range(len(tmp)):
                while tmp[right] - tmp[left] + 1 - (right - left + 1) > k:
                    left += 1
                res = max(res, right - left + 1)
        return res
```
2. *2875: Minimum Size Subarray in Infinite Array*
- You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` and an integer `target`. A 0-indexed array `infinite_nums` is generated by infinitely appending the elements of nums to itself.
Return the length of the shortest subarray of the array `infinite_nums` with a sum equal to target. If there is no such subarray return `-1`.
`1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
`1 <= target <= 109`

Example: 
`Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,3], target = 4`
`Output: 2`
Explanation: In this example `infinite_nums = [1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,...]`.
The subarray in the range `[4,5]`, has the sum equal to `target = 4` and `length = 2`.
It can be proven that 2 is the shortest length of a subarray with sum equal to `target = 4`.
>When it comes to a infinity loop, think of Mod, notice all `num` in `nums` are positive, we can use sliding window

```python
def minSizeSubarray(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    k, mod = divmod(target, sum(nums))
    if mod == 0:
        return k * len(nums)
    left, ans, tmp = 0, float('inf'), 0
    arr = nums * 2
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        tmp += num
        while tmp > mod:
            tmp -= arr[left]
            left += 1
        if tmp == mod:
            ans = min(ans, i - left + 1)
    return k * len(nums) + ans if ans != float('inf') else -1
```
3. *3643: Flip Square Submatrix Vertically*
- You are given an m x n integer matrix grid, and three integers x, y, and k. 
The integers x and y represent the row and column indices of the top-left corner of a square submatrix and the integer k represents the size (side length) of the square submatrix.
Your task is to flip the submatrix by reversing the order of its rows vertically. Return the updated matrix.

Example1:
`Input: grid = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]], x = 1, y = 0, k = 3`
`Output: [[1,2,3,4],[13,14,15,8],[9,10,11,12],[5,6,7,16]]`

> Two Pointers again, but vertically
```python
def reverseSubmatrix(grid: List[List[int]], x: int, y: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    l, r = x, x + k - 1
    while l < r:
        for i in range(y, y + k):
            grid[l][i], grid[r][i] = grid[r][i], grid[l][i]
        r -= 1
        l += 1
    return grid
```

##### Binary Search 
1. *34: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array*
- Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
- If target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

> Binary Search then expand, good question not hard, can be used as starter

Example: 
`Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8`
`Output: [3,4]`
Example 2:
`Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6`
`Output: [-1,-1]`
```python
def searchRange(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        l, r = -1, -1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                l, r = mid, mid
                while r < len(nums) - 1 and nums[r + 1] == target:
                    r += 1
                while l > 0 and nums[l - 1] == target:
                    l -= 1
                break
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return [l, r]
```
